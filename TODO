Porting to new ggplot2 version
==============================
Files that are not ported:
- save.R
- switch_axis.R

Files that are partially ported (basic functionality seems to be there, but not fully tested):
- draw.R
- plot_grid.R
- add_sub.R
- gtable.R

Files that are fully ported:
- cowplot.R
- setup.R
- themes.R

Ideas for further development
=============================
For next version:
- update ggsave code to the latest version currently in ggplot2.
- write vignette for add_sub()

Longer term:
- add more finegrained formatting options to plot_grid, e.g., per-plot x and y offsets, label colors & fonts, etc.
- make a theme for individual plots and one for grouped plots (and one for faceted plots?), make sure that all default settings work well together.
