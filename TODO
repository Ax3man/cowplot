Ideas for further development
=============================
- update ggsave code to the latest version currently in ggplot2.
- add more finegrained formatting options to plot_grid, e.g., per-plot x and y offsets, same for labels, label colors & fonts, etc.
- make a theme for individual plots and one for grouped plots (and one for faceted plots?), make sure that all default settings work well together.
