Package: cowplot
Title: C. O. Wilke-approved plots using ggplot2
Version: 0.3.0
Authors@R: "Claus O. Wilke <wilke@austin.utexas.edu> [aut, cre]"
Description: Some helpful extensions and modifications to the ggplot2 library.
    In particular, this package makes it easy to combine multiple ggplot2 plots
    into one and label them with letters, e.g. A, B, C, etc., as is often
    required for scientific publications. The package also provides a streamlined
    and clean theme that is used in the Wilke lab.
