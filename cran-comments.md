## Test environments
* local OS X install x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0 (64-bit), R 3.1.2

I didn't test this on the latest development version of R, which I don't currently have installed. However, this package uses only very simple and straightforward R code, so I expect it to work on any recent version of R.

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was one NOTE:
    Maintainer: ‘Claus O. Wilke <wilke@austin.utexas.edu>’
    New submission

## Downstream dependencies
None exist at this time.
